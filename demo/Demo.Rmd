```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("lculibrk/Ploidetect-package")
library(Ploidetect)
```

## Data import

First we import the requisite data, formatted as discussed on the README.md

```{r cars}
dat <- read.table()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
